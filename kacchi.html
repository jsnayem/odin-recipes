    <p>Kacchi, also known as Kacchi Biryani, is a traditional Indian dish that hails from the region of Hyderabad. It is a flavorful and aromatic rice dish made by layering marinated raw meat (usually chicken or mutton) with partially cooked rice, saffron, and a blend of aromatic spices. The dish is then slow-cooked or "dum-cooked" until the meat is tender and the flavors have melded together, resulting in a fragrant and delicious one-pot meal. Kacchi Biryani is known for its distinctive taste and is often served with raita or a side salad.</p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the Meat: In a large bowl, combine the meat (chicken or mutton) with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, garam masala powder, salt, and vegetable oil. Mix well to ensure the meat is evenly coated with the marinade. Allow it to marinate for at least 2 hours, or overnight in the refrigerator for best results.</li>
        <li>Parboil the Rice: Wash the Basmati rice thoroughly and soak it in water for about 30 minutes. Drain the rice. In a large pot, bring 4-5 cups of water to a boil. Add salt and the soaked, drained rice. Parboil the rice until it's about 70-80% cooked (it should still have a slight bite to it). Drain the rice and set it aside.</li>
        <li>Layer the Biryani: In a heavy-bottomed and deep pan or a biryani pot, spread a layer of the marinated meat at the bottom. Add a layer of parboiled rice over the meat. Sprinkle fried onions, saffron-soaked milk, ghee, fresh coriander leaves, and fresh mint leaves on top of the rice. Repeat the process to create multiple layers, ending with a layer of rice on top.</li>
        <li>Dum Cooking: Place the lid tightly on the pot. You can seal the edges with dough to trap the steam, or you can use a heavy object to press down the lid. Cook the biryani on low heat (simmer) for about 20-25 minutes. This slow-cooking process is known as "dum cooking" and allows the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>Serve: Once done, remove the pot from heat and let it sit, covered, for another 10 minutes to allow the steam to settle. Gently fluff the biryani with a fork, being careful not to break the rice grains. Serve hot, garnished with boiled eggs (if desired) and lemon wedges. Enjoy your homemade Kacchi Biryani!</li>
