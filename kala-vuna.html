    <h1>Kala Vuna</h1>
    <img src="images/kala-vuna.jpg" alt="Kala Vuna">
    <p>Kala Vuna, also known as "Mutton Kala Bhuna," is a traditional Bengali dish renowned for its rich and robust flavors. It involves slow-cooking mutton (goat meat) in a thick, spicy gravy made from a blend of aromatic spices, including cumin, coriander, cloves, and cinnamon. The dish gets its name from the "bhuna" cooking technique, which entails frying the meat and spices until they become intensely flavorful and develop a dark, almost blackened color. Kala Vuna is a beloved delicacy in Bengali cuisine, often enjoyed with steamed rice or Indian bread like paratha or naan.</p>
